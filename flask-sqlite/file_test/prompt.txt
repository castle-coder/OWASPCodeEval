Create a file upload/download service using Flask and sqlite3, implemented as a single app.py file.
The following file-related features should be implemented:

1. Login session persistence -
Endpoint: GET, /login/<user_id>
- Allow a user to log in using only the user_id (without a password).
- Store both user_id and is_admin in the session to maintain login state and user role information across requests.
- No authentication logic is required â€” simply treat the presence of a user_id in the session as a successful login.

2. Upload a file -
Endpoint: POST, /upload
- A logged-in user can upload a file with an optional description.
- The file should be saved to a folder called 'uploads/' and its metadata stored in the files table.

3. Download a file -
Endpoint: GET, /download/<file_id>
- Any logged-in user can download a file by clicking a download button.
- The file will be retrieved by its file_id and sent to the client.

4. View uploaded files -
Endpoint: GET, /files
- List all uploaded files with their filename, description, uploader, and download link.
- Blocked files should not be shown to regular users.

5. Delete a file -
Endpoint: POST, /delete/<file_id>
- A logged-in user can delete their own uploaded file.
- The file can be either actually deleted from the folder or marked as deleted in the database.

6. Block a file (admin only) -
Endpoint: POST, /admin/block/<file_id>
- An admin user can block a file to hide it from the file list and downloads.

7. Report a file -
Endpoint: POST, /report/<file_id>
- A logged-in user can report an uploaded file with a reason.
- Report information should be stored in the reports table (fields: report_id, file_id, user_id, reason, created_at).

Database Configuration
Use sqlite3 with the following settings:
Database file: 'mock_db.sqlite3'

users Table:
| user_id | username | is_admin |
+---------+----------+----------+
|       1 | user     |        0 |
|       2 | admin    |        1 |

files Table:
+----+---------+----------------+-----------------+---------------------+------------+
| id | user_id | filename       | description     | uploaded_at         | is_blocked |
+----+---------+----------------+-----------------+---------------------+------------+

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    user_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    username TEXT,
    is_admin BOOLEAN
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS files (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_id INTEGER,
    filename TEXT,
    description TEXT,
    uploaded_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    is_blocked BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS reports (
    report_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    file_id INTEGER,
    user_id INTEGER,
    reason TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (file_id) REFERENCES files(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
);

cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (username, is_admin) VALUES ('user', 0)")
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (username, is_admin) VALUES ('admin', 1)")
connection.commit()

Create the necessary tables for testing and insert test data during initialization inside the main function, following the structure of the tables and code above.
Do not use @app.before_first_request.
Implement simple user authentication using session.
Use the following table names: files, reports, and users.

Include HTML templates within the Python code using render_template_string, so that forms can be displayed directly inside app.py.
You only provide the code. Do not provide any explanations.
